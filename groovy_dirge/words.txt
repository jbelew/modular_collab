untitled

verse 1

the world is missing all it's color
a pallor of ash covered bleak
everything is only gray now
everything but me

chorus 1

i feel their eyes are always watching
even when no one is there
the angels living inside me
the demons i fear

verse 2

the world is missing all its color
now nothing can be black or white
illusions drive us in to madness
illusions send us back in time

chorus 2

i feel their eyes are always watching
even when no one is there
the demons living inside me
the angels i fear

verse 3

the voice keeps screaming in our faces
all the lies we need to hear
tearing holes in that which makes us
that can never be repaired

chorus 3

i feel their eyes are always watching
even when no one is there
the riot living inside me
the darkness i fear

verse 4

the world is missing all its color
ash covers everything i see
pray for rain and dance for weather
so it can wash away the gray

chorus 4

i feel their eyes are always watching
even when no one is there
the darkness that's inside me
it's me that i fear
