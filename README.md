## Etherial 93pbm
Typical modular patch for me, and an example as to how I lay out projects. Really busy and could use some editorial work, along with having new parts added to create more of a structure. Gain staging on the mix is a mess and needs to be redone. It's set up with two sends and you can use whatever delay and reverb you have. Ignore all the other missing FX warnings, they're just for compressors that I added for the mixdown and the mastering chain.  

## Noisy 120pbm
A loop based on some complex, band-pass, hi-hat like, noise sounds. The 303 line starts getting really annoying after a while. More opportunities here since it's just a simple, starting pattern. Needs a better kick for starters. 

## Enjoy Evolution
A modular remix of Enjoy the Silence, especially leveraging the Rossum Evolution filter (thus the name). Lot's of plugins here (Decimort, Pro-Q 3, Smart:Comp, Waves Platinum Bundle, Abbey Road Collection) since this was a session intended to refine my mixing skills. The first track is a rendered version of the "Music Bus" to simplify collaboration. Sounds are mostly sourced from the modular or my Emax sample library and rendered via the ER-301. It's a complex project with over 60 tracks, but if anyone wants to play with the arrangement, add parts, etc ... feel free.
