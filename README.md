# modular_collab

## Etherial 93pbm
Typical modular patch for me. Really busy and could be edited down or have new parts added, or rearranged. Need to redo the gain staging on the mix. It's set up with two sends. Ignore all the other missing FX warnings. 

## Noisy 120pbm
A bit of a loop playing with some complex, band-pass, hi-hat like sounds. The 303 line starts getting really annoying after a while.
